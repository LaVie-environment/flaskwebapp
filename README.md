This Flask applications creates a small web interface that displays the most-starred repositories for selected programming languages querying GitHub's API. The code hnadles both user input and API erros gracefully.

Break up the app's architecture into self-contained modules to reduce coupling and increase cohesion. Each module handles one specific responsibility, minimizing dependencies between them.

The **api.py** is the entry point for this application, while the functional entry point is the index() function, orchestrating everything that happens when a user unteracts with the application.

The **app.py** defines one main route() decorator. It tells Flask that the index() function should handle both GET and POST requests.
Flask executes the code inside the if request.method == 'GET' block whenever a client (for example, a browser) sends a GET request when loading the page or refreshing it; in contract, Flask executes the code in the elif request.methos == 'POST' block when a client sends a POST request by submitting the form.

The **api.py** module connects to the GitHub REST API to retrieve public repositories with the most stars, filtered by programming language and minimum star count.

The **exceptions.py** centralizes error handling by defining a custom exception class called GitHubApiException. Any module that needs to report an API failure uses this custom exception.
